# Bingo
 Bingoware Fork and updates 

So I took the original source code from here . http://bingoware.sourceforge.net/ .
I have started updating the codebase, it now has Server Side Events and can currently be used for a 'small' scale online bingo game.

Over the next month I will update the code so that it is more user friendly for online community based people.
